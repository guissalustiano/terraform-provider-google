## Ensuring no plan-time difference to latest provider release (optional)

In a case where you are editing an existing field you might want to ensure the resource you are modifying doesn't result in a diff to existing deployments. You can run set the [environment variable](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules/blob/a30da2040ca7b8bd37186d8521a911e7469da632/mmv1/third_party/terraform/utils/provider_test.go.erb#L284-L286) `RELEASE_DIFF` before running a test. This will append plan only steps using the latest released/published provider (`google` or `google-beta`) after all configuration deployments to ensure uniformity.

```
export RELEASE_DIFF=true
TF_LOG=TRACE make testacc TEST=./google TESTARGS='-run=TestAccContainerNodePool_basic' > output.log
```
